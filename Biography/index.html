        <p>
            I’ve always enjoyed performing and began my life on stage as a dancer and gymnast
            when I was 3. Passionate as I was about all things theatre, it soon became apparent
            that my natural skills lay more on the music side of things than in the physical
            arts. Though I have continued to enjoy dance, I turned my career aspirations away
            from the stage itself and into the orchestra pit. Playing the viola for various
            productions whilst at school and through university, I knew I hadn’t quite yet found
            my perfect fit.</p>
        <p>
            I have always enjoyed singing and had been singing in choirs for years when I started
            voice lessons at age 16. I wasn’t so confident in my abilities at first but with
            the help and guidance of my teachers and friends I soon found my way back onto the
            stage. It was at university that I first experienced opera and I immediately fell
            in love with it! My first role was playing &lsquo;Spring&rsquo; and &lsquo;The Sorceress&rsquo;
            in <i>Dido &amp; Aeneas</i> in my second year. Hooked from then I decided to follow
            up my dreams of becoming a professional singer at music college. There I found many
            other likeminded people and worked with some of the country&#39;s leading coaches
            and conductors, as well as amazing teachers.</p>
        <p>
            Lovely as it would be to say my performing career started when I graduated and I’ve
            never looked back, I&#39;m a pragmatist at heart so after my Masters I decided to
            do a PGCE. This was largely because I&#39;d done teaching in differing forms and
            in various countries during study and work placements abroad, so I trained and learnt
            properly how I could pass on my love and passion for music to others. Since then
            I&#39;ve had the privilege of working with some amazing schools and choirs, developing
            a love of performing in kids that others inspired in me at school.</p>
        <p>
            Now I enjoy the best of both worlds: a lively and varied performing career and the
            opportunity to develop and inspire others!</p>
